# Forceful

The object of Forceful is to collect as many letters as you can. As you accumulate letters, you begin to weight yourself down, meaning you move slower. The orbit of letters around you grows, if it gets too close to a magnet you will lose your score (and letters). There are two traps, oil and tar. The tar trap will slow you down, if you already weigh alot you may just get stuck. The oil will make you slip, if you weight alot here you may move so fast the letters fall out of orbit. As your score goes up the more dangerous it gets.
